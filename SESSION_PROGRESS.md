**Session Time:** 01:53 - 01:53  
**Commits:** 1  
**Files Modified:** 1

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

### Commit 1: `83768f7` - fix: handle empty arrays in resources POST endpoint
**Date:** November 7, 2025, 01:53:42  
**Author:** Batuhan Cagil

**Changes:**
- Fixed handling of empty arrays in resources POST endpoint validation data transformation
- Added proper checks for `body.lessonIds` and `body.topicIds` before mapping operations
- Returns `undefined` for lessons when `lessonIds` is empty or undefined
- Returns empty array `[]` for topics when `topicIds` is empty or undefined
- Prevents validation errors when creating resources without lessons or topics

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/resources/route.ts` (+16 lines, -12 lines)
  - Updated `validationData.lessons` to check if `body.lessonIds` exists and has length > 0 before mapping
  - Added conditional check: `body.lessonIds && body.lessonIds.length > 0`
  - Updated topics mapping to check if `body.topicIds` exists and has length > 0
  - Returns `undefined` for lessons when no lessonIds provided
  - Returns `[]` for topics when no topicIds provided
  - Improved null/undefined safety for array operations

**Technical Details:**
- The fix addresses an edge case where empty arrays were being passed to the validation schema
- Previously, `body.lessonIds?.map()` would return an empty array even when `lessonIds` was `[]`
- Now properly distinguishes between `undefined` (no lessons) and `[]` (empty lessons array)
- The validation schema expects `undefined` when no lessons are provided, not an empty array
- This prevents validation errors when creating resources without lesson/topic assignments

**Impact:**
- Fixes bug where creating resources without lessons/topics could cause validation errors
- Improves API robustness by properly handling edge cases
- Better alignment with validation schema expectations
- Prevents potential runtime errors from empty array operations

  .refine(
    (val) => {
      if (!val || val.trim() === '') return true // Allow empty for partial updates
      const types = val.split(',').map(t => t.trim()).filter(t => t !== '')
      if (types.length === 0) return true // Allow if all parts are empty after trimming
      const validTypes = ['TYT', 'AYT']
      return types.every(t => validTypes.includes(t))
    },
    { message: 'Tip değeri TYT veya AYT olmalıdır (virgülle ayrılmış olabilir)' }
  )
  .default('TYT')
```

**Impact:**
- Enables lessons to have multiple types (e.g., "TYT,AYT")
- Maintains validation for single types (e.g., "TYT" or "AYT")
- Supports partial updates with empty type field
- Error message updated to reflect comma-separated support
